# Dotfiles of xasx

There's nothing special in here for the moment. This repo mainly serves for myself as a
mnemonic of everything I once looked up, for example

- various configs of different zsh plugin frameworks
- the thousands of parameters of powerlevel9k
- a hint towards which tools I usually need to install other tools or similar

## But what do I do with all this information?

Share it between work and home, between native Linux and WSL
